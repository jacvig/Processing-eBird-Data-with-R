Processing eBird Data with R

This repository contains code sets on processing eBird data with R. It is a work in progress; updates and additional files will be added as I progress.

## Files
'Processing eBird data code.R'
General code for working with your own eBird data. Includes downloading, cleaning, and visualising checklist data.

'CreateATripReport.R'
Code for creating a species list for a specific region/hotspot.

outputs
This folder contains species lists for various locations. 

## Please note
I am using eBird data to teach myself data processing and visualisation with R. Therefore, the code is only as robust as my experience. 
It will hopefully improve as I learn more about R.
