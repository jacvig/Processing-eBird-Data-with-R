Processing eBird Data with R

This repository contains code sets on processing eBird data with R. It is a work in progress; updates and additional files will be added as I progress.

## Files
'Processing eBird data code.R'
General code for working with your own eBird data. Includes downloading, cleaning, and visualising checklist data.

'CreateASpeciesList.R'
Code for creating a species list for a specific region/hotspot.

'Visualising and Analysing eBird data.R'
Code for more advanced work with eBird data. Includes code for visualising data for a specific location to see number of species observed daily over a month and comparing across a number of years.

## outputs : 
This folder contains the species lists generated by the code. They are examples and not needed for running the code.

## data : 
This folder contains data files exported from eBird. To run the code, please use your own data or data that you have downloaded from eBird.

## Please note
I am using eBird data to teach myself data processing and visualisation with R. Therefore, the code is only as robust as my experience. I have indicated where I have adapted code from others and have provided links to these great resources.
